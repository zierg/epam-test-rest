### Tasks:

1. Build a web service that offers an endpoint which returns all cities from either the JSON or CSV.
2. Enhance the service to also include a density field, which should be number of people per sq km.
3. Add the capability to sort by name / population / area in descending or ascending manner.
4. Additionally, add a feature to filter the cities by name using a “contains” filter.
5. Create an endpoint to add new cities with name, population and area during runtime.
6. Create an UI which loads the full dataset from the service and shows it in a table with all 4 columns.
7. Improve the UI by highlighting rows of cities having a population over 1 million.
